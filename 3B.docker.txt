3B.Problem Statement: Create Docker Container Environment (NVIDEIA Docker or any other).

Docker:Docker is a open platform which is used for shipping and running applications and it provides the ability to run an application in a loosely isolated environment
and the environtment is nothing but a containner.Because of this isolation and security,we can run many containners simultaneously on a given host
In Short :if you as developer ,developed a software that you can share this with other developer or tester,which can test this with docker img id ,remove the bugs and then forward for customer.

   2. open VS code editor  Add docker (from microsoft) extension(search docker) in VS Code.

   3.Install Docker from the left extention icon on VS Code editor

 
---Steps to Implement the Assignment:

  Step-1: Create a folder (Note: Folder name should be in lowercase).  
  Let the folder name be: docker_demo

  Step-2: Create file in the same folder with file name as- Dockerfile and press enter key. (Note: Don't add any file extension after the file name) write code as given below in it:
           
              FROM node:alpine(make sure no space around colon)
              COPY . /docker_demo
              CMD node /docker_demo/yourcode.js

   
   Step-4: Create any file with any extension( such as .js, .txt, .py, etc....) in the same above folder(Here, docker_demo) and write some content in the file. 
  Let the file name be: yourcode.js

  The file contains the following code:
  console.log("Name:Jyoti Thakur");
  console.log("Designation: Assistant Professor");
  console.log("Subject: Web Technolgy");
  
   
 Step-5: Open terminal  in VS Code and type the following command(go to current directory i.e docker_demo) and type:
              docker --version

We will see the version of your docker if it is installed successfully. 

Step-6: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:
             docker build -t docker_demo . 

  We will see that it is successfully built(building images for docker_demo folder i.e creating containner). 

  Step-7: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:
                 node yourcode.js

  It will display the contents in your file which is created in Step-2.

  Step-8: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:
                docker images

  You will see the docker images with REPOSITORY, TAG, IMAGE ID, CREATED (Time), SIZE.
